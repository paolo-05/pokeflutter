# ❓ What is `Pokeflutter`?

> A flutter project for playoung around with the PokeAPI.

# 🎯 My first Flutter project

In my school, ITIS Galilei Crema, during the first part of the 2023, came a person working for [Sorint Lab](https://www.sorint.com/en/) that showed us how to get started with Flutter and the Dart language. The person only told us how to create the frontend part without any API fetching but, on my own, by searching up a bit I started to work with the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and I came up with a discrete work. 

# 🚧 From the desing to the app

The person from Sorint also showed us the prototype of the app made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/9Gm6Q8GPKa4LPAnFBfKueq/HackersGen-'22---Pokedex-App-Course---UI?node-id=28%3A1633&t=gh80Q2eocUIA3DBo-1) and by following that we were able to make the app working and also pretty.
